# Automated-Sentiment-Analysis

Utilized Praw to scrap Reddit (WallStreetBets) posts and comments through API and analyzed each userâ€™s
sentiment with NLTK(Natural Language Toolkit) to understand current stock market flow.

Planning to make new analyzing data set to increase prediction accuracy of the stock market sentiment.
For example, at the stock market, "Bullish" indicates the price is going up(positive) and "Bearish" indicates
the price is going down(negative).
